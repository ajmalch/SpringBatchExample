# SpringBatchExample
Demonstrate SpringBatch

Clone the repository and configure as a maven project

To Run the application :-

You need a database as Job Repository is configured as database(We have used MySQL for the demo)

Update the database specific entries in context.xml(If you change from MySQL) and database.xml
These config files are under SpringBatchExample/src/main/resources/spring/batch/config

After that just run com.mkyong.App as a java application.

You should see the result in xml/outputs/report.xml file
